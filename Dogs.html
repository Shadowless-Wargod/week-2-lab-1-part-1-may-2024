  <article><p>The Joyful World of Doberman Pinschers
    Doberman Pinschers are one of the coolest dog<br>
    breeds out there, and they bring so much happiness to people’s lives! These sleek, strong pups<br>
    are known for their shiny coats, pointy ears, and super loyal personalities. If you’re looking for<br>
    a furry friend who’s both a protector and a cuddle buddy, a Doberman might just be your<br>
    perfect match.</p></article>
  
    
    <h2>Cane Corso</h2>
    <article></article><p>The Cane Corso is a huge, strong dog from Italy that’s built like a tank and super loyal. They’re 23<br>
     to 27 inches tall, weigh 85 to 110 pounds, and have muscular bodies with short coats in colors like<br>
     black or brindle. Originally bred to guard, hunt, and even fight in Roman times, they’re natural<br>
     protectors with a serious look that says, “I’ve got this.” They’re smart and can learn commands<br>
     fast, but they need firm training, exercise, and space to stay happy and out of trouble</p>
    
     <p>Even though they look tough, Cane Corsos are big softies with their families. They love their<br>
        owners, stick close, and are gentle with kids if raised right. They don’t bark much, but they’ll growl<br>
        if something’s off, using their size to scare off strangers. With the right care—socializing them<br>
        early and being a strong leader—you’ll get a cuddly, fearless friend who’s always ready to keep you safe.</p>
